# Bank Client

There's an ATM Machine program as well as a Frontend program that handles
all the personal information and can make direct changes to the client's
balances. Both ATM Machine and Frontend go through the same clients database
which is handled by Backend.

Hypothetically, ATM Machine is the program used by the client of the bank's business 
and frontend is used by the bank business itself, editing client's personal information
and having the power to change client's balance on a whim.
